## Background

As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In my new role, I will be generating reports for city officials looking to publicise and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilisation. Each month, bike data is collected, organised, and made public on the Citi Bike Data.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process.

The main purpose for the this analysis is to discuss any findings, through visualisations of January data for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024 and find noiceable trends and phenomenons within this specified period. 

# Analysis question 1: What trends can be observed between memberships recorded in January annually between 2022 to 2024?

Across the month of January in 2022, 203 and 2024 there has been a total of 133,498 rides, with 106,418 rides amongst members and 27,082 casual rides. January 2022 had the lowest record rides amongst casual (6,731 rides) and members (20,031) in comparison to January in the following two years. Despite the increase in casual riders in 2023 at approximately 200% from 2022, 2023 this trend did not continue in 2024 as riders reduced to just under 8,000 rides. In comparison members also increased at just over 200% from 2022 to 2023 and has stayed consistant in 2024 with only a 899 ride decrease as visualised in below graph.

From the data as visulised below, members are more likely to opt for a classic bike ride at 67,032 across all 3 annual months. The electric bike was the only other preference members chose for their citi-bike hire at a total of 39,384 rides. Unlike casuals though with 177 rides in total for the docked bikes, members did not hire any docked bikes during the 3 January periods. One other trend observed was that casual riders did not have a preference for classic (13,694) or electric bikes (13,211) with only a variance of 483 rides

The last observation made from the annual month data relative to membership status was that casual riders on average rode for a longer duration across all January periods with the a total average duration across 2022 to 2024 of 22.85 minutes per ride, where members averaged at an average duration of 12.73 minutes per ride across the 3 year period.

# Analysis question 2: What trends can be observed per rideable type January annually between the chosen period?


# Station Analysis:

**What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?**

**What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why do you hypothesise these are the top locations?**

**What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why?**

**What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?**
