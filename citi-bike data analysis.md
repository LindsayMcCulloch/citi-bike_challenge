## Purpose

As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In my new role, I will be generating reports for city officials looking to publicise and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilisation. Each month, bike data is collected, organised, and made public on the Citi Bike Data.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process.

The main purpose for the this analysis is to discuss any findings, through visualisations of January data for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024 and find noiceable trends and phenomenons within this specified period across a total of 133,498 rides

## Analysis question 1: What trends can be observed between memberships recorded in January annually between 2022 to 2024?

Across the month of January in 2022, 203 and 2024 there has been a total of 133,498 rides, with 106,418 rides amongst members and 27,082 casual rides. January 2022 had the lowest record rides amongst casual (6,731 rides) and members (20,031) in comparison to January in the following two years. Despite the increase in casual riders in 2023 at approximately 200% from 2022, 2023 this trend did not continue in 2024 as riders reduced to just under 8,000 rides. In comparison members also increased at just over 200% from 2022 to 2023 and has stayed consistant in 2024 with only a 899 ride decrease as visualised in below graph.

From the data as visulised below, members are more likely to opt for a classic bike ride at 67,032 across all 3 annual months. The electric bike was the only other preference members chose for their citi-bike hire at a total of 39,384 rides. Unlike casuals though with 177 rides in total for the docked bikes, members did not keep their ride active and dock their bikes for later use during the 3 January periods. One other trend observed was that casual riders did not have a preference for classic (13,694) or electric bikes (13,211) with only a variance of 483 rides despite there being membership benefits that 'all new Citi Bike memberships and renewals will come with 60 free e-bike minutes' as promoted by bicycling.com.

The last observation made from the annual month data relative to membership status was that casual riders on average rode for a longer duration across all January periods with the a total average duration across 2022 to 2024 of 22.85 minutes per ride, where members averaged at an average duration of 12.73 minutes per ride across the 3 year period.

## Analysis question 2: What trends can be observed per rideable type January annually between the chosen period?

The total trips per rideable type has been measured as below, allowing us to explore the data and compare rideable type popularity in January each year. In 2022, we saw the least amount of rides total with classic bikes measuring at a total 16,952 rides and electric bikes popularity trailing at just over 6k rides less. in 2023 this trend of popularity in classic bike rides almost tripled where electric bike rides only increased by just over 2.5k rides. Unsurprisingly given the e-bike popularity and increase in available e-bikes across the US, in 2024 the electric bike rides increased dramatically to 30,846 rides now exceeding the classic bike rides recorded in previous years for the month of January.

 The docked bike riders, being those who choose to dock their bike whilst still keeping the ride active and allowing them to continue use of their citi-bike,  were significantly lower at only 77 rides in January. This trend of riders choosing to not dock their bikes for continued use was also recurring in 2023 with only 100 rides. Surprisingly in 2024 there was not a single bike docked with an active ride showing riders are less likely to continue use after their trip is complete. With further data this could open the investigation as to why this may be the case, some possible reasons could be the additional charges incurred on docked bikes to ensure "ownership" of bike until the rider requires the bike. Another could be the availaiblty of other bikes/full docking stations meaning other bikes are readily available for use at any given time for the rider and they do not need to worry about their original bike being used by another rider.

The docked bikes recorded in 2022 and 2023 spent a comparable average duration at docking stations while under hire with bikes in 202 spending a an average 138.4 minutes docked and 134.8 minutes docked in 2023.

From below pie chart it is shown that the average duration in 2022 of actual rides in January was 23.95 minutes per ride across both rideable types. where in 2023, the duration of rides across both types was almost halved. in 2024 this number has again decreased to just under 9 minutes per ride across both rideable types. From this trend we can see people are spending less time using the citi-bikes and it can be hypothesised that this is likely caused by greater availability of bikes and potentially due to increased popularity causing more people to use the bikes for short trips/errands and recreationally rather than as a mode of transport. As recounted by John MacArthur, a transport researcher at Portland State University in a publication made by The Guardian; 'Half of all trips made by Americans are under three miles – a distance ebikes can easily conquer. Suddenly, cycling isn’t just a fitness activity or something done for fun by small children – it is a method to run errands and get to work in car-centric America.'
